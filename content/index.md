:AboutMe

Hi, I'm Douglas Ochner, current living in Lisbon - Portugal.
BSc in Information Systems from [CatolicaSC](https://www.catolicasc.org.br/)\[2014-2022\].

I'm currently working for [Aubay Portugal](https://www.aubay.pt/) and also as an freelancer.

In 2013, I started my IT career as an IT Support Analyst for [Lunelli](https://www.lunelli.com.br). After seven years of hands-on experience, I decided to pursue a new path and became a Software Developer. I joined [Multiplier](https://www.multiplier.com.br/) in 2020 and started taking on freelance work in frontend development. Through this, I was able to acquire a lot of knowledge and connect with great people. 2 years later in 2022 on, my wife and I decided to move to Portugal where I got the opportunity to work as a Frontend Developer for  [Aubay Portugal](https://www.aubay.pt/) and I am loving every moment of it!

I have a wide range of interests, such as:
🖥️ OS's<small>(Windows, MacOS, Linux)</small>;
🤖 Eletronics<small>(Robots, Arduino, IoT)</small>;
🪚 DIY<small>(who doesn't?)</small>;
🎮 Games<small>(FPS games, Board games, RPG's)</small>;
🍔 Comfort foods;

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
